# Research Coordinator Application - Priority Fixes

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. ✅ Consolidate Duplicate Route Files [COMPLETED]
### 2. ✅ Remove Express Backend [COMPLETED]
**Priority**: Critical  
**Location**: `/backend/src/routes/`  
**Issue**: Multiple versions of the same routes exist (groups.ts, groups-temp.ts, groups-full.ts, groups-demo.ts)  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Identified the correct/latest version of each route file (groups.ts, auth.ts, users.ts, projects.ts)
- [x] Deleted redundant files (groups-temp.ts, groups-full.ts)
- [x] Moved demo files to separate /demo directory for clarity
- [x] Updated imports in index.ts
- [x] Tested build and server startup - all working

**Files to Review**:
- `groups.ts` vs `groups-temp.ts` vs `groups-full.ts` vs `groups-demo.ts`
- `auth.ts` vs `auth-demo.ts`
- `users.ts` vs `users-demo.ts`
- `projects.ts` vs `projects-demo.ts`

### 2. ✅ Remove Express Backend [COMPLETED]
**Priority**: Critical  
**Issue**: The app was using dual architecture (direct Supabase + Express backend)  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Confirmed app works entirely without backend
- [x] Configured Supabase SMTP with AWS SES for email verification
- [x] Tested registration and email verification works
- [x] Fixed password field UI issue
- [x] Removed entire backend directory and unused API code
- [x] Simplified architecture to: Mobile App → Supabase only

**Result**: Much simpler, more reliable architecture with no server to maintain!

### 3. ✅ Enable Email Verification [COMPLETED]
**Priority**: High  
**Issue**: Email verification was disabled (emailRedirectTo: undefined)  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Configured Supabase SMTP with AWS SES 
- [x] Updated registration to enable email verification
- [x] Changed emailRedirectTo to proper verification URL
- [x] Tested registration and email verification works
- [x] Fixed password input field UI issues

**Result**: Email verification now works seamlessly through Supabase + AWS SES!

### 4. ✅ Rate Limiting [NO LONGER NEEDED]
**Priority**: High  
**Issue**: API endpoints had no rate limiting  
**Resolution**: With backend removed, Supabase provides built-in rate limiting:
- Auth endpoints: Protected by Supabase's built-in limits
- Database operations: Protected by RLS and Supabase's quotas
- SMTP: 30 emails per hour limit (configurable)

**Result**: Rate limiting is now handled by Supabase infrastructure!
