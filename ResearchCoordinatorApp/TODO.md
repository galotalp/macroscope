## üìù Recent Progress (Session Notes)

- [x] **Successfully switched to secure storage configuration:**
  - `project-files` bucket: **Private** (with RLS policies for security)
  - `profile-pictures` bucket: **Public** (for easier web access)
- [x] **Fixed mobile app functionality** with new storage setup
- [x] **Implemented web platform helpers** for cross-platform file operations
